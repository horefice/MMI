Working :)
Still needed after copying these files: Install PureData Extended, Processing (both free)
Instalation: Move the folder oscp5 to the folder 'libraries' inside 'processing' folder
How to use: Conect Kinect, open Synapse, open and run any file inside SynapseReceiver folder, stay in front of kinect and make a "trident" or a "psi"
Results: You will see in the white screen a beautiful sketch of what is recognized from yourself and all arguments needed are easily accessed through skeleton.getJoint("leftknee").posScreen, for example
